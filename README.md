# File Renamer Automation Script

A simple Python script to automatically rename all files in a selected folder using a custom prefix and number sequence.

## How it Works

1. Prompts the user to input:
   - A folder path
   - A custom prefix (e.g. "image", "doc", "project")
2. Renames all files in the folder with the given prefix and number.

Example:
```
IMG_001.jpg -> image_1.jpg
Resume.pdf -> image_2.pdf
```

## How to Run

```bash
python file_renamer.py
```

Then follow the prompts in the terminal.

Great for organizing folders, labeling projects, or prepping client deliverables.
